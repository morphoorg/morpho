morpho
======
The morpho package:

    A python interface between stan/pystan Markov Chain Monte Carlo packahe for meta analysis and generation of fake data.


Requirements
======
	We will need pystan in order to run this system.

	The pystan (and mc-stan module) can be downloaded via github or directly.
	
	see   http://mc-stan.org	
	and   http://mc-stan.org/pystan.html

	PyStan has the following dependencies:

	Python: 2.7 or 3.3
	Cython: 0.19 or greater
	NumPy: 1.7 or greater

Install
======
	PyStan and the required packages may be installed from the Python Package Index using pip.

	       	      pip install pystan
		      	     
	One can install Cython and NumPy in a similar manner


Running
======
	A sample executible is shown in the main directory:

	  	  python run_krypton_analysis.py  <name_of_json_config_file>
		  
		  Essentially, the following takes place.  One can "generate" fake data according to a specific model (krypton_generator.stan) or run on actual data (krypton_analysis.stan).  The sequence for events is as follows

		  1.  The script looks for cached versions of the .stan model file.  If not, it generates a new one and saves it.  The cached models exist in the cache directory

		  2.  The input files are read into the system.  Right now, my input files are set for R-style formats, but we can use anything that makes a dict file.  I will leave it to higher up programers to deal with this.

		  3.  There are two input files (actually, any number you want).  The first input file has general information common to both the generator and the analysis models (for example, the magnetic field parameters).  The second input file can contain input that is specifc to the model being run (for example, data entries for data, model parameters for the generator).

		  4.  The model generates a number of Markov Chain files (in the specified directory) according to the specific model.  If there is no data, this in principle can be used to generate fake data.  That feature isn't quite implemented yet.

		  5.  Very generic plots and screen output is created, just to flash some results.
