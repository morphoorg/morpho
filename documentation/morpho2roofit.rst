How to use RooFit
-----------------------------------

`RooFit`_ is a package in the ROOT suite.
It produces tools to define models in physics analysis and perform fits using maximum Likelihood, Likelihood sampling or generate fake data following Likelihood.
In this framework, users can define probabilities and pdfs using analytic formulas or numerical evalutions.
This feature is what makes RooFit attractive: it comes with all the functions already includes into ROOT plus numerical evaluations methods (like convolution products via Fast Fourier Transform).
Other useful features are that RooFit will automatically normalize the pdfs while evaluating them and that Likelihood can be built using either binned or unbinned data.
