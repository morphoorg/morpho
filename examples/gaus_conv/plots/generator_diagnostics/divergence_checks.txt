n_eff / iter looks reasonable for all parameters.
Rhat looks reasonable for all parameters.
14.0 of 500 iterations ended with a divergence (2.8%). Try running with larger adapt_delta to remove the divergences.
0 of 500 iterations saturated the maximum tree depth of 10. (0.0%)
E-BFMI indicated no pathological behavior.
