n_eff / iter looks reasonable for all parameters.
Rhat above 1.1 indicates that the chains very likely have not mixed.
23.0 of 2000 iterations ended with a divergence (1.15%). Try running with larger adapt_delta to remove the divergences.
0 of 2000 iterations saturated the maximum tree depth of 10. (0.0%)
E-BFMI indicated no pathological behavior.
