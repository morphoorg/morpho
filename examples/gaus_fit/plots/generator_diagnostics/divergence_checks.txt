n_eff / iter looks reasonable for all parameters.
Rhat looks reasonable for all parameters.
0.0 of 500 iterations ended with a divergence (0.0%).
307 of 500 iterations saturated the maximum tree depth of 10. (61.4%) Run again with max_depth set to a larger value to avoid saturation.
E-BFMI indicated no pathological behavior.
